# HealthCare-Dashboard
Attempted to Create a Visual-Interactive Dashboard that emphasis on important KPI metrics of HealthCare Industry.
Data visualization has become a mandate in modern medical organizations.

To bring relevant information into focus, the dashboard design extracts and illustrates essential performance indicators of healthcare: treatment costs, patient diseases, waiting times, occupancy rate etc.

The presented ‘data visualization’ would target healthcare stakeholders, leaders and managers; who have a solid understanding of the workflow and delivery of healthcare services.

The interpretations from this viz can aid in data-driven decisions for optimal outcomes and improvements in organizational processes: help in the continual path of progress in terms of cutting cost, improving patient care, research and education, and most importantly save lives!
